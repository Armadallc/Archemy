Do not take any actions following this prompt. We are still brainstorming, but i like the direction its going. 
Ritten has a fully functioning Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) tool built into its platform. How would this compare to Ritten’s RCM?
Lets go with Option 2: Separate Billing Module, with the following outline: 
Using multi-layer security: 
* Using multi-layer security: Authorized Uer’s primary login
* 30 Minute billing sessions or timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity 

Implementation Options
* PIN System: 4-6 digit PIN for quick access (I prefer users with permissions use primary login for app access and simple 4 digit pin for billing)

Core CMS-1500 Management
* Form Builder: Auto-populate CMS-1500 from trip data
* Batch Processing: Submit multiple claims at once
* Claim Tracking: Monitor submission status and payments (what other integrations would we need for this?)
* Rejection Management: Handle denied claims and resubmissions (what other integrations would we need for this?)

Compliance & Documentation (what other integrations would we need for this?)
* HIPAA Audit Log: Track all PHI access
* Retention Policies: Automatic data archival
* Compliance Checklists: Ensure all requirements met
* Export Tools: Generate reports for audits

Integration Features (we will also need include billing codes, any additional medicaid waivers infor some come clients, and modifiers for applicable trips/clients)
* Insurance Verification: Real-time eligibility checks (what other integrations would we need for this?)
* Electronic Submissions: Direct to Medicaid systems (what other integrations would we need for this?)
* Bank Integration: Track payments and deposits (what other integrations would we need for this?)
Advanced Features (Will we need bill scrubbing integrations? If so which ones. If not, can we develop our own? If we can, what regulations, guidelines will we need) 
* Prior Authorization Tracking: Manage approval workflows (what other integrations would we need for this?)
* Denial Analytics: Identify patterns in claim rejections (what other integrations would we need for this?)
* Provider Credentialing: Maintain certification records (what other integrations would we need for this?)
* Quality Assurance: Flag incomplete or problematic claims (what other integrations would we need for this?)
User Management
* Billing Staff Permissions: I dont think we need another role. Simple Billing permissions should suffice. What do you think? 
* Training Mode: Practice environment for new staff (love this!)
* Backup Authorization: Secondary approvers for high-value claims
* Emergency Access: Controlled override procedures (what would this be for?)
