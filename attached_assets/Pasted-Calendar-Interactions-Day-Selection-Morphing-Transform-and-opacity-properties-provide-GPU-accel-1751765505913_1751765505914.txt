Calendar Interactions:
	•	Day Selection Morphing: Transform and opacity properties provide GPU-accelerated animations that “won’t affect layout” and “keep the browser humming along smoothly” 
	•	Trip Indicator Pulse: Use keyframe animations for active status indicators with coral accent tonal variations
	•	Hover Depth Effects: Apply subtle scale transforms and box-shadow gradients using your existing color tints
	•	Smooth Month Transitions: Implement sliding animations using CSS transforms rather than abrupt content swaps
Form Enhancement Opportunities:
	•	Input Focus Rings: Progressive coral-tinted glow effects using CSS box-shadow and tonal gradients
	•	Validation State Morphing: Smooth background color transitions between neutral → coral (error) → completed states
	•	Submit Button Transformations: Scale, shadow, and background gradient animations on interaction
	•	Field Error Animations: CSS keyframes can create “shake” or “bounce” effects for immediate feedback 
Status Change Dynamics:
	•	Driver Availability Indicators: Animated background gradients shifting between your tonal variations
	•	Vehicle Status Badges: Pulsing opacity effects for urgent states, smooth scale transitions for completions
	•	Real-time Data Updates: Fade-in animations for new information, avoiding jarring content jumps
System-Wide Motion Design:
	•	Navigation State Changes: CSS transitions handle “simple state changes” efficiently with GPU optimization 
	•	Loading Indicators: Coral accent spinning animations or progress bar fills using linear gradients
	•	Modal Entrances: Scale and opacity combinations for professional overlay presentations
	•	Data Table Updates: Row highlight animations using your casper-blue tonal range
Performance-Optimized Implementation:
Modern best practices emphasize “transform and opacity” as the most efficient animation properties, avoiding “height, width, border, margin, padding” changes that trigger layout recalculations . Your minimal palette enables sophisticated effects through:
	•	Tonal Gradient Animations: Smooth transitions between color variations
	•	Layered Shadow Effects: Multiple box-shadows creating depth without performance penalties
	•	Micro-interaction Feedback: Subtle scale transforms (0.95x → 1.05x) for button presses
	•	Staggered Element Reveals: Sequential animations for dashboard metric cards
JavaScript-Enhanced Possibilities:
	•	Intersection Observer APIs: Trigger animations as elements enter viewport
	•	State Management: Coordinate multiple element animations during status changes
	•	Real-time Data Binding: Smooth transitions when transportation data updates
	•	Gesture Recognition: Touch-friendly interactions for mobile deployment
